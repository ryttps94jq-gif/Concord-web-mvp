# Concord (Community Edition)

**Concord** is a fully local, modular cognitive engine designed to run offline, create knowledge structures (DTUs), and support OS-like reasoning layers for personal, research, and creative use.

This repository contains the *Community Edition*, which includes:

- ✔ Fully local backend (`server.js`)
- ✔ Local DTU engine + starter DTUs
- ✔ Working UI (`src/App.jsx`, `main.jsx`)
- ✔ PersonaOS (simple persona-to-DTU interaction)
- ✔ CRETI engine (Core / Reasoning / Evidence / Testing / Impact)
- ✔ OS Stack toggles (dream, evolution, autogen, autocrawl)
- ✔ Autoprocess heartbeat system
- ✔ Full open-source license (Apache 2.0)

Concord CE is built for:
- Researchers  
- Students  
- Innovators  
- Developers  
- Anyone who wants a *local-first cognitive workspace*  

No ads.  
No tracking.  
No cloud dependencies.

## 📦 Included Starter DTUs

In `dtus.js`, the repo includes safe starter DTUs:

- CRETI Template  
- PersonaOS Sample Persona  
- Evolution / Dream sample seeds  
- Basic knowledge scaffolds  

These are safe, simple, and do not expose deeper Concord logic.
