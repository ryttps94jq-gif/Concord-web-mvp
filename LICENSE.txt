1. Purpose

The Concord Source License – Community Edition (“License”) enables individuals, students, researchers, and open-source contributors to freely use, run, study, and modify ConcordOS for personal and self-hosted purposes.

This License exists to protect:
	•	the integrity of the Concord ecosystem,
	•	the DTU economy,
	•	the Concord lexicon and architecture,
	•	the Global Concord network,
	•	and the Creator Marketplace

…from unauthorized commercial exploitation, repackaging, or rebranding.

This License is designed to be friendly to the community while ensuring Concord cannot be “sniped,” cloned, or commercialized by third parties without written permission from the Concord Project Owner.
