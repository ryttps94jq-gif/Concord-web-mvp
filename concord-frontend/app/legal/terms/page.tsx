        <p>
          Concord utilizes a virtual currency called &quot;Concord Coin&quot; (CC) to facilitate
          transactions within the platform. By using Concord Coin, you acknowledge and agree to the
          following:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Virtual Currency:</strong> Concord Coin is a virtual
            currency with no real-world monetary value. It exists solely within the Concord
            ecosystem and cannot be exchanged for fiat currency, cryptocurrency, or any other form
            of real money.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">No Cash Value:</strong> Concord Coin has no cash value
            outside the platform. You may not sell, trade, or transfer Concord Coin outside of the
            Concord marketplace.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Exchange Rate:</strong> The exchange rate between
            Concord Coin and any purchase mechanism (including earned credits) is determined solely
            by Concord and is subject to change at any time without prior notice.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Non-Refundable:</strong> Concord Coin purchases and
            transactions are generally non-refundable, except as required by applicable law or as
            specifically stated in our refund policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Platform Currency:</strong> Concord Coin may be used
            to purchase usage rights to Digital Thought Units (DTUs), access premium features,
            support creators, and participate in marketplace transactions.
          </li>

        {/* 5. Content Ownership & DTUs */}
        <SectionHeading id="content-ownership" number="5" title="Content Ownership & DTUs" />
        <p>
          Concord employs a content system based on Digital Thought Units (DTUs). Your content
          rights are governed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Your Content:</strong> You retain full ownership of
            the original content you create and upload to the platform as DTUs. Concord does not
            claim ownership of your content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">License to Concord:</strong> By uploading content to
            the platform, you grant Concord a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to
            host, store, display, reproduce, and distribute your content as necessary to operate
            the Service. This includes making your content available to users who have acquired
            usage rights, indexing for search functionality, and creating necessary technical
            copies (such as caching and backups).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">DTU Structure:</strong> Content uploaded to Concord is
            organized as DTUs, which may include metadata, versioning information, integrity
            hashes, and associated licensing terms as defined by the creator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">License Termination:</strong> The license granted to
            Concord for your content will terminate when you permanently delete the content from
            the platform, subject to reasonable time for technical removal and any surviving
            obligations (such as existing usage rights already granted to other users).
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* 6. Usage Rights Model */}
        <SectionHeading id="usage-rights" number="6" title="Usage Rights Model" />
        <p>
          Concord operates on a usage-rights model rather than traditional ownership transfer. When
          you purchase or otherwise acquire access to a DTU, you are acquiring a license to use that
          content, not ownership of the content itself.
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">License Grant:</strong> Each DTU purchase grants you a
            personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable (unless explicitly permitted by the DTU
            license) right to access and use the content according to the license terms set by the
            creator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">License Tiers:</strong> DTUs may be offered under
            different license tiers (e.g., personal use, commercial use, extended rights), each
            with specific permissions and restrictions as defined by the creator.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">No Ownership Transfer:</strong> Acquiring usage rights
            to a DTU does not transfer ownership of the underlying intellectual property. The
            original creator retains all ownership rights.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Usage Tracking:</strong> Concord may track usage of
            DTUs for purposes of enforcing license terms, calculating creator royalties, and
            maintaining platform integrity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Revocation:</strong> Usage rights may be revoked if
            you violate the license terms, these Terms of Service, or if the content is removed due
            to a valid legal claim (such as a DMCA takedown). In cases of revocation due to legal
            claims, we will make reasonable efforts to provide refunds or alternative remedies.
          </li>
        </ul>

        {/* 7. Canonical Architecture */}
        <SectionHeading id="canonical-architecture" number="7" title="Canonical Architecture" />
        <p>
          Concord uses a canonical deduplication architecture to efficiently manage content. You
          understand and agree to the following regarding this system:
        </p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">One Canonical Per Content:</strong> When content is
            uploaded to Concord, the system identifies whether identical or substantially identical
            content already exists. If it does, the system may reference the existing canonical
            version rather than storing a duplicate copy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Deduplication Rights:</strong> By uploading content,
            you consent to Concord&apos;s deduplication process. This means your content may be
            stored as a reference to a canonical version shared with other users who uploaded
            identical content.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Integrity Verification:</strong> Each canonical DTU is
            protected by cryptographic integrity hashes. These hashes ensure content has not been
            tampered with and verify the authenticity of the original upload.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">Priority Rights:</strong> In cases of content
            disputes, the earliest verified upload timestamp may be used as evidence of priority,
            though this does not constitute proof of original authorship.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong className="text-zinc-300">No Impact on Ownership:</strong> Canonical
            deduplication is a technical storage optimization and does not affect content ownership
            or licensing. Each creator retains their rights regardless of whether their content
            references a shared canonical version.
          </li>
        </ul>
